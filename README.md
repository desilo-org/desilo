# OpenLabs
OpenLabs is a blockchain-based peer review platform for scholarly research that promotes open science through the use of tokenomics and a robust reputation system. Our mission is to mitigate the replication crisis currently experienced in the soft sciences.

## Getting Started
OpenLabs is live for testing on Mumbai testnet. Head over to https://www.openlabs.link/ to begin posting about your own research projects! 

## Main Features

Make OpenLabs your research companion by uploading your supplementary materials (e.g. scripts, datasets, drafts) to the platform and receive feedbacks from other users. 

Reviewers gain non-transferrable tokens known as Social Credit for their work, which builds up their reputation and allow them to vote on governance policies, create new 'Labs' and vouch for others' work.

Labs are decentralized groups that can be created to cater to specific research interests. Once a project becomes affiliated with a lab through community vouching, any reviewer of that project also gains lab-specific Social Credit in addition to the usual global Social Credit.

## Tech Stack
Ceramic -> manage file version control and edit permission, allowing changes to projects to be publicly tracked and traceable. 

Web3.storage -> File storage 

IDX -> track decentralized identitites of our users, including their profile picture and linked wallet addresses.

### Next steps 

Chainlink -> improve security, such as ensuring IPFS files with the correct content are supplied onto the blockchain

The Graph -> manage the large amount of data queries currently made through the frontend.
